# Progress: Job Filtering Plugin

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Main filter form with all filtering options
- ✅ Sidebar widget with simplified filtering
- ✅ AJAX-based filtering without page reloads
- ✅ Location-based filtering with radius control
- ✅ Geolocation ("Use My Location") feature
- ✅ Google Places autocomplete for location input
- ✅ Distance calculation using Haversine formula
- ✅ Job results display with pagination
- ✅ Filter reset functionality

### Filtering Options

- ✅ Search query filtering
- ✅ Location and radius filtering
- ✅ Job category filtering
- ✅ Job type filtering
- ✅ Organization/company filtering
- ✅ Date posted filtering

### UI Components

- ✅ Custom dropdown selectors
- ✅ Radius slider with real-time updates
- ✅ Location input with autocomplete
- ✅ Geolocation button with status indicators
- ✅ Results counter
- ✅ Pagination controls
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

## Current Status

The radius filter functionality has been implemented and is working properly. The implementation includes:

1. **Frontend UI**:

   - Location input field with Google Places autocomplete
   - Radius slider for adjusting search distance (5km to 200km, default 50km)
   - "Use My Location" button for geolocation with visual feedback
   - Synchronized radius sliders for consistent user experience across main form and widget
   - Real-time updates as radius changes

2. **Backend Processing**:

   - Automatic geocoding of location inputs to get coordinates via Google Maps API
   - Distance calculation between search point and job locations using Haversine formula
   - Filtering of jobs based on calculated distance within the specified radius
   - Fallback to text-based location search if geocoding fails
   - Country restrictions for location searches (default: Australia)
   - Caching of coordinates with job listings to reduce API calls

3. **Results Display**:
   - Jobs within radius are displayed with pagination
   - Distance from search location is shown for each job (e.g., "5.2 km away")
   - Clear visual presentation of job cards with location information
   - Mobile-responsive design for all device types

## Known Issues

1. **Performance Concerns**:

   - Distance calculation for many jobs is resource-intensive, especially with large job databases
   - No batch processing implemented for distance calculations
   - Geocoding adds additional API calls which may impact performance and costs
   - No caching system for frequently searched locations

2. **Geocoding Limitations**:

   - Relies on Google Maps API with usage limits and potential costs
   - Basic fallback implemented for geocoding failures, but error messaging could be improved
   - API key management needs improvement (currently configured in settings)
   - Potential issues with international locations and address formats

3. **UI Refinements Needed**:
   - Radius slider could benefit from more visual feedback (e.g., map visualization)
   - Mobile experience needs improvement for location filters and radius controls
   - Multiple radius sliders (main form and widget) may cause confusion for users
   - No visual representation of search radius on a map

## What's Left to Build/Improve
