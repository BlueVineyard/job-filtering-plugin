# Progress: Job Filtering Plugin

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Main filter form with all filtering options
- ✅ Sidebar widget with simplified filtering
- ✅ AJAX-based filtering without page reloads
- ✅ Location-based filtering with radius control
- ✅ Geolocation ("Use My Location") feature
- ✅ Google Places autocomplete for location input
- ✅ Distance calculation using Haversine formula
- ✅ Job results display with pagination
- ✅ Filter reset functionality

### Filtering Options
- ✅ Search query filtering
- ✅ Location and radius filtering
- ✅ Job category filtering
- ✅ Job type filtering
- ✅ Organization/company filtering
- ✅ Date posted filtering

### UI Components
- ✅ Custom dropdown selectors
- ✅ Radius slider with real-time updates
- ✅ Location input with autocomplete
- ✅ Geolocation button with status indicators
- ✅ Results counter
- ✅ Pagination controls
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

## Current Status

The radius filter functionality has been fixed and is now working properly. The implementation includes:

1. **Frontend UI**:
   - Location input field with Google Places autocomplete
   - Radius slider for adjusting search distance
   - "Use My Location" button for geolocation
   - Synchronized radius sliders for consistent user experience

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Automatic geocoding of location inputs to get coordinates
   - Distance calculation between search point and job locations using Haversine formula
   - Filtering of jobs based on calculated distance within the specified radius
   - Fallback to text-based location search if geocoding fails

3. **Results Display**:
   - Jobs within radius are displayed
   - Distance from search location is shown for each job
   - Debug information shows current radius and coordinates

## Known Issues

1. **Performance Concerns**:
   - Distance calculation for many jobs could be resource-intensive
   - No batch processing for large job databases
   - Geocoding adds additional API calls which may impact performance

2. **Geocoding Limitations**:
   - Relies on Google Maps API with usage limits
   - Basic fallback implemented for geocoding failures, but could be improved
   - API key is hardcoded and should be moved to settings

3. **UI Refinements Needed**:
   - Radius slider could benefit from more visual feedback (e.g., map visualization)
   - Mobile experience could be improved for location filters
   - Multiple radius sliders may cause confusion for users

## What's Left to Build/Improve
