# Product Context: Job Filtering Plugin

## Purpose
The Job Filtering Plugin enhances WordPress job listing functionality by providing advanced filtering capabilities. It solves the problem of users having to manually search through numerous job listings by offering intuitive filtering options, particularly location-based filtering with radius control.

## Problems Solved
1. **Inefficient Job Searching**: Without filtering, users must browse through all job listings, which is time-consuming and inefficient.
2. **Location Relevance**: Users need jobs within a specific geographic area, which standard job listings don't easily accommodate.
3. **Specific Job Requirements**: Users often have specific requirements (job type, category, company) that need targeted filtering.
4. **User Experience**: Standard job listings lack the interactive, dynamic filtering experience users expect.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Provide a clean, easy-to-understand filtering interface.
2. **Responsive Filtering**: Filters should update results in real-time without page reloads.
3. **Location Awareness**: Allow users to filter jobs based on proximity to a specific location.
4. **Flexible Radius Control**: Enable users to adjust the search radius to expand or narrow their job search area.
5. **Multiple Filter Criteria**: Support combining multiple filters for precise job matching.
6. **Clear Results Display**: Present filtered results clearly with relevant job information.
7. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the filtering experience works well on all device sizes.

## Key Workflows
1. **Basic Job Search**:
   - User enters search terms
   - System filters jobs containing those terms
   - Results update dynamically

2. **Location-Based Filtering**:
   - User enters a location
   - User adjusts radius slider to set search distance
   - System filters jobs within the specified radius
   - Results show distance from search location

3. **Combined Filtering**:
   - User selects multiple filter criteria (location, job type, category, etc.)
   - System applies all filters with AND logic
   - Results show only jobs matching all criteria

4. **Geolocation-Based Search**:
   - User clicks "Use My Location" button
   - Browser requests location permission
   - System uses coordinates to find nearby jobs
   - User can adjust radius to expand/narrow search

5. **Filter Reset**:
   - User clicks "Clear all" button
   - All filters reset to default values
   - Results show all available jobs
